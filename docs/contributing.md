## Submitting pull requests

To get started developing for pyControl, fork the relevant pyControl repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyControl).

The [master](https://github.com/pyControl/code/tree/master) branch of the repository contains the last numbered release.
The [dev](https://github.com/pyControl/code/tree/dev) branch contains the latest version which typically has more features but may be more buggy.
pyControl development should build on the latest commit in the dev branch to facilitate integrating it back into the codebase.

Once you are happy with your changes, or you are ready for some feedback, push it to your fork and send a pull request.
