# Contributing to pyControl

The pyControl project welcomes contributions from developers and
users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of ways, including:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

To get started improving pyControl, fork the relevant pyControl repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyControl).

The default branch of the repository contains the last numbered release. The dev branch contains the latest version which typically has more features but may be more buggy. pyControl development should build on the latest commit in the dev branch to facilitate integrating it back into the codebase.

## Reporting an Issue

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and pyControl version, and ideally include a screenshot of the error message.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes, or you are ready for some feedback, push it to your fork and send a pull request.
